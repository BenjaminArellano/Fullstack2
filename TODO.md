# Session Validation for Cart Addition - TODO

## Completed Steps:
- [x] Analyzed existing code for cart, session, and login functionality
- [x] Created comprehensive plan and got user confirmation
- [x] Modify `src/assets/js/agregar.js` to add session validation before cart addition
- [x] Created `src/assets/js/validar_sesion2.js` for admin session validation with logout redirect to index.html
- [ ] Test the implementation (redirect to login if not authenticated, allow addition if authenticated)

## Next Steps:
1. Test the changes in a browser environment
2. Verify edge cases (expired tokens, multiple clicks, etc.)
